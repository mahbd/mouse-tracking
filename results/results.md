All users trained with 5% contamination rate (nu=0.05 for SVM, contamination=0.05 for Isolation Forest)

#### Self-Testing Results (Baseline)
| User   | Samples | SVM Anomalies | ISO Anomalies |
|--------|---------|---------------|---------------|
| atiq   | 20,585  | 4.99%         | 5.00%         |
