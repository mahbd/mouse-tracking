## Evaluation and Metrics

- Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1; per-class support; confusion matrix.
- Anomaly detection: fraction flagged anomalous; cross-user anomaly rates.
- Calibration: verify self-test anomaly rate matches contamination/nu; adjust thresholds as needed for deployment.
- Robustness checks: sensitivity to segmentation length and feature subsets.
