# Abstract

We study mouse tracking as a behavioral biometric for user identification and anomaly detection. Using 76,693 behavioral segments from four users, we engineer motion-, speed-, and acceleration-based features from fixed 50-event windows. Random Forest reaches 85.36% classification accuracy. For single-user anomaly detection, One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest calibrated at 5% contamination achieve expected self-test anomaly rates and reveal substantial cross-user differences—up to 31.6% anomalies—demonstrating distinctive behavioral signatures. We detail a practical end-to-end system with cross-platform collectors, a feature pipeline, model training scripts, and an optional Windows GUI for real-time detection. We discuss limitations and ethical aspects and outline directions for scaling, robustness, and privacy-preserving deployment.
