In the contemporary digital landscape, traditional authentication mechanisms such as passwords and PINs are increasingly vulnerable to various security threats including social engineering, brute force attacks, and credential theft. This has necessitated the development of more robust and continuous authentication systems that can verify user identity transparently without disrupting user workflow. Behavioral biometrics, which analyzes the unique patterns in how individuals interact with computing devices, presents a promising solution to these challenges.

This thesis presents a comprehensive investigation into mouse tracking as a behavioral biometric modality for user identification and anomaly detection systems. Mouse dynamics, encompassing cursor movement patterns, click behaviors, scroll activities, and temporal characteristics, offer a rich source of behavioral information that can be continuously monitored without explicit user intervention. Unlike physiological biometrics such as fingerprints or facial recognition, behavioral biometrics can adapt to gradual changes in user behavior over time and provide continuous authentication capabilities.

Our research addresses two fundamental problems in behavioral biometrics: multi-user classification (determining which user is currently interacting with the system) and single-user anomaly detection (identifying when the current interaction patterns deviate significantly from a user's established behavioral baseline). These capabilities are essential for implementing continuous authentication systems that can detect unauthorized access attempts and potential security breaches in real-time.

The experimental methodology involved the collection of comprehensive mouse interaction data from four participants over extended periods, resulting in a substantial dataset of 76,693 behavioral segments. Each segment was constructed using a fixed-window approach of 50 consecutive mouse events, ensuring consistent temporal scope across all behavioral samples. From these raw event sequences, we engineered a comprehensive feature set of 36 distinct behavioral characteristics, encompassing temporal dynamics (segment duration, event timing patterns), spatial characteristics (total distance traveled, path straightness), kinematic properties (velocity and acceleration statistics including mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis), and contextual information (application window usage patterns, time-of-day distributions).

For the multi-user classification task, we evaluated six different machine learning algorithms: Random Forest, Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Principal Component Analysis combined with XGBoost, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks. The classification experiments employed rigorous 5-fold stratified cross-validation to ensure robust performance estimates and prevent overfitting. Feature selection focused on a core subset of 16 behavioral features that excluded direct identity indicators and event counts, emphasizing pure behavioral dynamics.

The experimental results demonstrate the viability of mouse dynamics for user identification, with Random Forest achieving the highest classification accuracy of 85.36%. This performance significantly outperformed simpler baseline methods, with Decision Trees achieving 77.24%, PCA+XGBoost reaching 70.20%, KNN obtaining 60.30%, MLP achieving 44.43%, and Naive Bayes scoring 38.37%. The superior performance of ensemble methods, particularly Random Forest, suggests that user identification benefits from capturing complex non-linear interactions between behavioral features.

For anomaly detection, we implemented and evaluated two complementary approaches: One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM) with Radial Basis Function kernel and Isolation Forest. Both algorithms were configured with a contamination parameter of 5%, representing the expected proportion of anomalous behavior in normal usage scenarios. The anomaly detection models were trained individually for each user to establish personalized behavioral baselines, then validated through both self-tests (detecting anomalies within the same user's data) and cross-user tests (measuring how often other users' behaviors are flagged as anomalous).

The anomaly detection results reveal significant behavioral distinctiveness between users. Self-test validation confirmed that both algorithms achieved the expected ~5% anomaly rate on their respective training users, validating the contamination parameter calibration. More importantly, cross-user anomaly detection revealed substantial behavioral differences, with some users exhibiting highly distinctive patterns. For instance, models trained on one user's data flagged up to 31.6% of other users' behaviors as anomalous, indicating strong individual behavioral signatures. Isolation Forest generally demonstrated higher sensitivity to cross-user differences compared to One-Class SVM, making it potentially more suitable for strict security applications.

The practical implementation includes a complete end-to-end system architecture encompassing cross-platform data collection components (native C++ collectors for both Windows and Linux/Wayland environments), comprehensive preprocessing and feature engineering pipelines, robust model training frameworks, and a real-time graphical user interface for live anomaly detection. The Windows implementation utilizes low-level system hooks for precise event capture, while the Linux version employs libinput and udev interfaces, though requiring elevated privileges for system-level access.

Our analysis reveals several important insights into behavioral biometrics. First, the effectiveness of ensemble methods suggests that individual behavioral patterns emerge from complex combinations of multiple movement characteristics rather than single dominant features. Second, the significant variation in cross-user anomaly rates indicates that some individuals exhibit more distinctive behavioral patterns than others, which has implications for adaptive threshold setting in practical deployments. Third, the consistent performance across different evaluation folds suggests that behavioral patterns are relatively stable over the time periods examined, though longer-term temporal stability remains an area for future investigation.

The research also addresses important ethical and privacy considerations inherent in behavioral monitoring systems. Our approach emphasizes data minimization by focusing on movement dynamics rather than content or detailed application usage. The feature engineering process abstracts raw mouse coordinates into statistical summaries that preserve behavioral signatures while reducing privacy sensitivity. Additionally, we discuss the importance of user consent, data retention policies, and potential applications of privacy-preserving techniques such as federated learning and differential privacy.

Several limitations must be acknowledged. The study involved only four participants, which limits the generalizability of findings to broader populations and diverse usage scenarios. The temporal scope was relatively short-term, and long-term behavioral stability over weeks or months remains unexplored. Additionally, environmental factors such as different hardware configurations, varying physical conditions, and diverse application contexts were not systematically controlled, potentially affecting the robustness of behavioral models.

The implications of this research extend beyond academic contribution to practical applications in cybersecurity and human-computer interaction. The demonstrated feasibility of mouse-based continuous authentication opens possibilities for implementation in sensitive computing environments where traditional authentication methods are insufficient. The anomaly detection capabilities could enhance intrusion detection systems by identifying unauthorized access attempts that bypass conventional security measures.

Future research directions include scaling the evaluation to larger and more diverse user populations, investigating temporal stability over extended periods, exploring multi-modal fusion with other behavioral biometrics (such as keystroke dynamics), implementing advanced privacy-preserving techniques, and developing adaptive algorithms that can accommodate gradual behavioral changes over time. Additionally, real-world deployment studies would provide valuable insights into practical performance under diverse operating conditions.

In conclusion, this thesis demonstrates that mouse tracking behavioral features provide a viable foundation for both user identification and anomaly detection applications. The achieved 85.36% classification accuracy and meaningful cross-user anomaly discrimination support the potential for practical continuous authentication systems. With continued research addressing scalability, robustness, and privacy concerns, mouse dynamics can contribute significantly to the development of transparent, user-friendly security systems that enhance protection without impeding productivity.
