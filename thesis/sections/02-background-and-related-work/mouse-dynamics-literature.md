## Mouse Dynamics Literature

Early work leveraged constrained tasks; more recent studies mine free-form usage data. Features typically include kinematics (speed, acceleration), curvature/jerk, pause timing, and click sequences. Classifiers range from SVM and Random Forests to HMMs and deep models, though deep models require large datasets. Our approach favors feature-rich, classic ML due to data scale.

See \cite{rahman2021} for an example of authentication and region-of-interest inference from mouse movement data.
