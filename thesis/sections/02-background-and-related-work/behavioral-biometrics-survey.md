## Behavioral Biometrics Survey

Behavioral biometrics encompasses keystroke dynamics, mouse and touch gestures, gaze, gait, and stylometry. Strengths include continual monitoring and liveness; challenges involve variability due to fatigue, stress, or device changes. Mouse dynamics sit at the intersection of usability and security, providing a rich signal from routine interactions.
