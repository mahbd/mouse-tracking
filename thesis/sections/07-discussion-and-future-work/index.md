## 7.1 Interpretation

- High RF accuracy suggests non-linear feature interactions capture user-specific kinematics.
- Cross-user anomaly patterns quantify distinctiveness and inform threshold selection.

## 7.2 Limitations

- 4 users: limited external validity; potential sampling bias.
- Short horizon: temporal stability not assessed.
- Device and environment variability not controlled across diverse hardware.

## 7.3 Ethical and Privacy Considerations

- Avoid logging content; focus on dynamics and coarse context.
- Consider consent, transparency, and data minimization.
- Explore privacy-preserving training (federated learning, DP mechanisms).

## 7.4 Future Work

- Scale to larger, longitudinal datasets.
- Robustness: domain adaptation across devices and tasks.
- Multi-modal fusion with keystroke dynamics and application context.
- Real-time deployment studies; calibration for false positive control.
- Explainability: feature attribution to validate behavioral hypotheses.
