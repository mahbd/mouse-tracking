# Conclusion

This thesis demonstrates that mouse tracking behavioral features support both user identification and anomaly detection. On a dataset of 76,693 segments from four users, Random Forest achieved 85.36% accuracy for classification. One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest produced expected ~5% anomaly rates on self-tests and revealed meaningful cross-user differences, with Isolation Forest generally more sensitive.

These results support the viability of continuous, unobtrusive behavioral authentication. With larger and more diverse datasets, multi-modal fusion, and longitudinal evaluation, mouse dynamics can contribute to practical, privacy-conscious security systems.
