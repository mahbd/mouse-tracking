### 1.9.1 Primary Research Contributions

This research makes several significant and novel contributions to the field of behavioral biometrics and continuous authentication systems:

**1.9.1.1 Comprehensive Open-Source Implementation**

We provide a complete, production-ready implementation of a mouse-based behavioral biometric system that addresses real-world deployment requirements. This implementation represents a significant advancement over previous research that often focuses on algorithmic aspects while neglecting practical implementation challenges. Our system includes:

- **Cross-Platform Data Collection**: Native C++ collectors for both Windows and Linux operating systems, with specific adaptations for Wayland compositor environments. The Windows implementation utilizes low-level system hooks for precise event capture with minimal system overhead, while the Linux implementation employs libinput and udev interfaces for comprehensive event monitoring.

- **Robust Feature Engineering Pipeline**: A sophisticated preprocessing and feature extraction system that transforms raw mouse event streams into meaningful behavioral signatures through statistical analysis, temporal segmentation, and feature normalization procedures.

- **Production-Ready Model Training Infrastructure**: Complete training and evaluation frameworks for both user identification and anomaly detection tasks, including automated hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation procedures, and model persistence mechanisms.

- **Real-Time Analysis Capabilities**: A graphical user interface application that demonstrates real-time behavioral analysis and anomaly detection, suitable for deployment in operational environments where continuous authentication is required.

**1.9.1.2 Novel Feature Engineering Framework**

Our feature engineering approach represents a significant advancement in extracting behavioral signatures from mouse interaction patterns. We develop a comprehensive framework that encompasses multiple dimensions of behavioral characterization:

- **Temporal Dynamics**: Features capturing the temporal characteristics of mouse interactions, including segment duration, event timing patterns, and temporal distribution analysis that reveal individual differences in interaction rhythm and pacing.

- **Spatial Characteristics**: Geometric features that analyze movement patterns including total distance traveled, path straightness, directional changes, and spatial distribution patterns that reflect individual preferences for cursor positioning and movement strategies.

- **Kinematic Properties**: Advanced statistical analysis of velocity and acceleration profiles including mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, maximum, and minimum values that capture individual differences in movement smoothness, acceleration patterns, and control precision.

- **Contextual Information**: Features that capture application usage patterns, time-of-day distributions, and window interaction behaviors while maintaining privacy through statistical abstraction rather than detailed content monitoring.

This multi-dimensional approach provides richer behavioral characterization compared to previous work that often focuses on limited feature sets or specific interaction scenarios.

**1.9.1.3 Rigorous Experimental Evaluation**

We conduct one of the most comprehensive experimental evaluations in the mouse dynamics literature, utilizing a substantial dataset of 76,693 behavioral segments collected from multiple users over extended periods. This evaluation provides several important contributions:

- **Algorithm Comparison**: Systematic comparison of six different machine learning algorithms across consistent experimental conditions, providing practical guidance for algorithm selection in behavioral biometric applications.

- **Cross-User Analysis**: Novel analysis of behavioral distinctiveness across different users, quantifying the discriminative power available for behavioral authentication and providing insights into individual behavioral variations.

- **Performance Validation**: Rigorous validation using cross-validation techniques, multiple evaluation metrics, and statistical significance testing to ensure reliable and reproducible results.

- **Practical Performance Assessment**: Analysis focused on practical deployment requirements including computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, and integration challenges with existing security infrastructure.

**1.9.1.4 Advanced Anomaly Detection Methodology**

Our approach to single-user anomaly detection represents a significant advancement in applying behavioral biometrics for continuous authentication:

- **Dual Algorithm Evaluation**: Comprehensive comparison of One-Class Support Vector Machines and Isolation Forest algorithms for behavioral anomaly detection, providing insights into algorithm strengths and application scenarios.

- **Cross-User Validation**: Novel experimental methodology that validates anomaly detection models by testing their ability to distinguish between different users' behavioral patterns, providing quantitative assessment of behavioral distinctiveness.

- **Threshold Analysis**: Systematic investigation of threshold setting strategies and their impact on false positive and false negative rates in practical deployment scenarios.

- **Real-Time Application**: Demonstration of real-time anomaly detection capabilities through practical implementation that can process behavioral data with minimal latency.

**1.9.1.5 Privacy and Ethics Framework**

We address important privacy and ethical considerations that are often overlooked in behavioral biometrics research:

- **Data Minimization Strategies**: Development of feature engineering approaches that preserve behavioral discrimination while minimizing privacy-sensitive information collection.

- **Consent and Transparency Guidelines**: Practical frameworks for implementing transparent behavioral monitoring systems that respect user privacy and autonomy.

- **Privacy-Preserving Deployment**: Analysis of deployment strategies that maintain behavioral authentication effectiveness while implementing strong privacy protections.
