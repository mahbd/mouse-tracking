\newpage

In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, traditional authentication mechanisms are facing unprecedented challenges. Password-based systems, despite their widespread adoption, suffer from numerous vulnerabilities including weak password selection, password reuse across multiple platforms, susceptibility to social engineering attacks, and the growing threat of automated brute-force attacks. Multi-factor authentication, while providing additional security layers, often introduces friction in user workflows and may not be suitable for continuous verification scenarios where users require seamless, uninterrupted access to computing resources.

The emergence of behavioral biometrics represents a paradigm shift toward more sophisticated, user-friendly authentication systems that leverage the unique patterns inherent in human-computer interaction. Unlike traditional physiological biometrics such as fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial recognition, behavioral biometrics focus on how individuals perform specific actions rather than their physical characteristics. This approach offers several compelling advantages: behavioral patterns can be monitored continuously without explicit user action, they adapt naturally to gradual changes in user behavior over time, and they provide a transparent authentication experience that does not interrupt normal computing activities.

Mouse tracking, as a behavioral biometric modality, presents particularly attractive characteristics for practical implementation. Every computer interaction involving graphical user interfaces generates a continuous stream of mouse events including movements, clicks, scrolls, and hover patterns. These interactions occur naturally during normal computer usage, requiring no additional hardware or explicit user cooperation. The ubiquity of mouse-based interfaces across desktop computing platforms makes this approach broadly applicable across diverse computing environments.

## 1.1 Research Context and Motivation

The motivation for this research stems from several converging trends in cybersecurity and human-computer interaction. First, the increasing sophistication of cyber attacks has highlighted the inadequacy of perimeter-based security models that rely solely on initial authentication. Advanced persistent threats, insider attacks, and account takeover scenarios require continuous monitoring and verification capabilities that can detect unauthorized access even after initial authentication has been completed.

Second, the growing emphasis on user experience in security design has created demand for transparent authentication methods that provide strong security without impeding productivity. Traditional security measures often create a trade-off between security strength and usability, leading to user resistance and potential circumvention of security controls. Behavioral biometrics offers the possibility of maintaining high security standards while preserving, or even enhancing, user experience.

Third, the proliferation of remote work and distributed computing environments has expanded the attack surface and reduced the effectiveness of traditional network-based security controls. In scenarios where users access sensitive resources from various locations and devices, continuous authentication becomes essential for maintaining security assurance throughout computing sessions.

The specific focus on mouse dynamics is motivated by several technical and practical considerations. Mouse interactions generate rich behavioral signals that encompass spatial, temporal, and kinematic characteristics. The frequency of mouse events during typical computer usage provides sufficient data density for real-time analysis and decision-making. Additionally, mouse tracking can be implemented using standard operating system interfaces without requiring specialized hardware or significant system modifications.

## 1.2 Problem Statement

This research addresses two fundamental challenges in behavioral biometrics: user identification and anomaly detection. The user identification problem seeks to determine "who is currently using the system" based on observed behavioral patterns. This capability supports applications such as user-specific interface customization, personalized security policies, and multi-user systems where explicit user identification may be impractical or undesirable.

The anomaly detection problem focuses on identifying when observed behavior deviates significantly from an established baseline for a known user, answering the question "is the current behavior consistent with the expected user's normal patterns?" This capability is crucial for detecting unauthorized access, account compromise, or other security incidents that occur after initial authentication.

Both problems present unique technical challenges. User identification requires developing features and models that capture consistent behavioral signatures while remaining robust to natural variations in user behavior. Anomaly detection demands establishing reliable behavioral baselines and setting appropriate thresholds that balance security (detecting genuine threats) with usability (minimizing false alarms).

## 1.3 Research Objectives

The primary objective of this research is to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of mouse tracking as a behavioral biometric for continuous authentication applications. This broad objective encompasses several specific research goals:

**1.3.1 System Design and Implementation**

## 1.5 Scope and Limitations

While this research provides significant insights into mouse-based behavioral biometrics, several important limitations must be acknowledged. The evaluation involves a relatively small number of participants (four users), which may limit the generalizability of findings to broader populations with diverse demographic characteristics, technical expertise levels, and usage patterns. The temporal scope of data collection, while substantial in terms of event count, represents a relatively short time horizon that may not capture longer-term behavioral evolution or adaptation effects.

The experimental environment, while designed to capture natural computer usage, may not fully represent the diversity of real-world deployment scenarios including different hardware configurations, software applications, network conditions, and physical environments. Additionally, the research focuses specifically on desktop computing scenarios with traditional mouse interfaces, and findings may not directly apply to other input modalities such as touchpads, trackballs, or touch interfaces.

The evaluation emphasizes technical feasibility and performance metrics while providing limited analysis of user acceptance, privacy concerns, and integration challenges that would be critical for practical deployment. The research also does not address advanced attack scenarios such as behavioral spoofing or adversarial attempts to circumvent behavioral authentication systems.
